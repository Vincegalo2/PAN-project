# PAN Project: Predictive Analysis of Music Artist Popularity

Welcome to the PAN Project. This cool project came to life during my final sprint at WBS Coding School. I went deep into the fascinating universe of music, trying to figure out the web of connections between artist's song positions on charts, various rankings, the abundance of songs by each artist on different charts, and even their collaborations.

Basically, the main goal of this project is to peel back the layers of popular music world to reveal the intrincate details that makes an artist unique and therefore popular over time. So, stick around and let's explore the magic of music data together! ðŸŽµ #PANProject

## Overview

Intrigued by the possibility of uncovering a hidden metric that could encapsulate the populartity of the artists dominating charts with different songs over time and across various categories on the Billboard panel, I, as my first task, went to collect a huge amount of data from their catalog. This massive dataset was then transformed into a unified global ranking, forming the foundation for the exploring stage of the project.

Following this, my goal shifted towards predicting a sneak peek into the future, an attempt to forecast the future popularity of artists. This involves the extensive use of a supervised machine learning model. The charts are renewed every Thursday so you can easily try and see of this model can be a good predictor for what it comes next in the trajectory of any artist.

## Datasets

The datasets utilized in this project are currently stored locally. If you're eager to explore and try it out for yourself, I highly recommend downloading the up-to-date comprehensive dataset directly from Kaggle. You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ludmin/billboard). Happy exploring!
